# Swagger UI

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/swagger-ui.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/swagger-ui)

## Deployment for Team Tidal

Current steps to deploy are done manually. Involves, building a docker image, pushing it to ECR and updating (via terraform) the ECS image referenced on the cluster.

### Build docker image

Retrieve the login command to use to authenticate your Docker client to your registry.
Use the AWS CLI:

```
$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region ca-central-1)
```

Note: If you receive an "Unknown options: --no-include-email" error when using the AWS CLI, ensure that you have the latest version installed.

Build your Docker image using the following command:

```
git_sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
docker build -t 535558409775.dkr.ecr.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/swagger:$git_sha
```

### Push image to ECR

Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:

```
docker push 535558409775.dkr.ecr.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/swagger:$git_sha
```

This should result in an image version residing here:
https://ca-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories/swagger/?region=ca-central-1

### Deployment

Deployment is done by updating the value for the `version` variable configured via Terraform - https://github.com/tidalmigrations/infrastructure-live/blob/master/main/ca-central-1/production/services/swagger/terraform.tfvars#L46

- Update the value in the `terraform.tfvars` file  to the value of `$git_sha`. ie. the same value that the docker image was tagged with when it was created in the earlier steps.
- Follow the standard terraform deployment pattern and execute:
    - `terragrunt plan` - to confirm the changes being made.
    - `terragrunt apply` - to make the change and update the version
    - commit the version change to git and push to master for the `infrastructure-modules` repository

As a brand new version, written from the ground up, there are some known issues and unimplemented features. Check out the [Known Issues](#known-issues) section for more details.

This repository publishes to two different NPM modules:

* [swagger-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui) is a traditional npm module intended for use in JavaScript web application projects that are capable of resolving dependencies (via Webpack, Browserify, etc).
* [swagger-ui-dist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-dist) is a dependency-free module that includes everything you need to serve Swagger-UI in a server-side project, or a web project that can't resolve npm module dependencies.

For the older version of swagger-ui, refer to the [*2.x branch*](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/2.x).
